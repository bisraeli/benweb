  <li class="content-list-item">high-functioning but looking to achieve mastery of skills and content</li>
  <li class="content-list-item">on track but seeking to maximize their learning potential</li>
  <li class="content-list-item">facing executive functioning issues (including those without a name or diagnosis) and in need of foundational skill-building. </li>
</ul>


<p class="content-text"> Mr. Israeli focuses in particular on working
  with students to identify learning differences in math and language
  that affect learning outcomes in other subject areas.  This process
  aids students looking to accelerate the pace of their learning as well
  as those who need remedial skill development and support.
