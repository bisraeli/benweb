            <p class="content-text"> Although the ACT covers a wider range of topics than the SAT, it
              places greater demands on a student's ability to speed-read and move quickly through the test material.
              An added benefit of taking the ACT is that many schools - even some Ivies- accept it without the two SAT II subjects that are normally
              required for students taking the SAT. Ben generally recommends the ACT for students who feel they can work quickly.

            </a>
            <p class="content-text"> The redesigned SAT gives students the option of taking the writing section. The math section draws from a narrower range of topics while placing
              greater emphasis on the student's ability to read, parse, and decipher problems more complex than those from the former SAT. Compared to the ACT, the SAT requires stronger
              critical thinking skills. Ben generally recommends the SAT for students who have strong conceptual and problem solving skills but who may not work quickly enough to shine on the ACT.

            <p class="content-text"> The SAT II biology exam is a wonderful challenge for ninth and tenth grade students looking to establish the first important piece of
              their college applications. Getting this test out of the way early gives students more time to prepare for the ACT and SAT come crunch-time Junior year. Ben normally
              recommends this test for students taking advanced placement or intensive biology, depending on what the school offers.

              The SAT II math exam is a great way to prove to colleges that you are ready for college level mathematics coursework. While the test stops short of
              calculus, it covers a wide range algebra, geometry, trigonometry, and pre-calculus topics. Students are given 60 minutes to answer 50 challenging questions. Those who are up
              for the challenge will be rewarded as this test has a very forgiving curve. Answering as few as 43 out of the 50 questions can still result in a score of 800!
